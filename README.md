# soa-container

This is a POC of a microfrontend architecture, consisting of:
- a container
- microfrontend #1, handling authentication
- microfrontend #3, which contains a list of expenses on which the user can perform CRUD operations; it also allows the user to change their weekly spending limit
- microfrontend #3, which represents a notification area, where users can check their spending summaries.
