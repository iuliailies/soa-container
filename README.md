# soa-container

This is a POC of a microfrontend architecture, consisting of:
- a container
- microfrontend #1, which represents a list of expenses on which the user can perform CRUD operations
- microfrontend #2, which represents a settings&notifications area, where users can set a weekly expenses limit and check their spending summaries.
